# WhoGoHelp?

WhoGoHelp is a community-powered errand outsourcing platform built to connect people who need help with everyday tasks (like deliveries, pickups, queueing, etc.) to trusted local helpers — all within a safe, responsive, and user-driven system.

This project is live, actively used, and currently under continuous development.

## How It Works

1. Users (Posters) create errands with details, rewards, and location info.
2. Helpers browse available errands and offer help.
3. Poster selects a helper (future feature), or helper is auto-assigned (default).
4. Helper completes the errand → Poster confirms completion → Reward is transferred.
5. Rating system kicks in, and errand is marked as completed.
