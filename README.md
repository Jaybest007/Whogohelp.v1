# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# WhoGoHelp?

WhoGoHelp is a community-powered errand outsourcing platform built to connect people who need help with everyday tasks (like deliveries, pickups, queueing, etc.) to trusted local helpers — all within a safe, responsive, and user-driven system.

This project is live, actively used, and currently under continuous development.

## How It Works

1. Users (Posters) create errands with details, rewards, and location info.
2. Helpers browse available errands and offer help.
3. Poster selects a helper (future feature), or helper is auto-assigned (default).
4. Helper completes the errand → Poster confirms completion → Reward is transferred.
5. Rating system kicks in, and errand is marked as completed.
